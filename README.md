## Description

**This work presents an alternative and more efficient method for recognizing vehicle license plates in videos using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques.**

> Conducted at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo - USP](https://www5.usp.br/) under the guidance of [Prof. Nina S. T. Hirata](https://www.ime.usp.br/nina/).

Video-based Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) involves extracting vehicle license plate information from video captures. Traditional systems often require substantial computing resources and analyze multiple frames to identify license plates, resulting in high computational overhead. In this study, we propose two methods designed to efficiently extract license plate information from exactly one frame per vehicle, thereby significantly reducing computational demands.

The first method utilizes Visual Rhythm (VR) to generate time-spatial images from videos. The second method employs Accumulative Line Analysis (ALA), a novel algorithm that processes single-line video frames for real-time operations. Both methods utilize YOLO for license plate detection within the frame and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract textual information.

Experimental results on real-world videos demonstrate that our methods achieve comparable accuracy to traditional frame-by-frame approaches while processing at speeds three times faster.
